# README Program 2 - Phone List

Group Members:
Ty'Mon Harvey & Shane Brown

Project Description:
This program is focused on managing different phone types and their information, such as brand, model, year, and storage. The Phone data class will hold attributes such as brand, model, year, and price. A linked list will be used to store a collection of phones. 

Functions such as add, remove, get, and sort will be available. 

The program will feature a menu-driven interface where users can: import phone data from a file into the linked list, add a new phone to the list, display the current phone list, sort the phones by attributes like year or storage, save the current list to a new file or overwrite an existing one
